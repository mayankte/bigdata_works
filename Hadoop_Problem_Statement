Analyzing Book- Crossing Data
 
Data set Description:
The Book-Crossing dataset consists of 3 tables.

BX-Users:

This file contains the list of the users, their age and where they are collected. If that data is unavailable for any field then it is filled with NULL.

BX-Books:

It gives us the details about the book such as Book-Title, Book-Author, Year-Of-Publication, Publisher, Image-URL and ISBN. Here ISBN will act as a unique code for a book. Invalid ISBNs have already been removed from the dataset. URLs linking to cover images are also given, appearing in three different flavors (`Image-URL-S`, `Image-URL-M`, `Image-URL-L`) i.e.  small, medium, large. These URLs point to the Amazon web site.

BX-Book-Ratings:

It contains the book rating information. Ratings are either explicitly expressed on a scale from 1-10 (higher values denoting higher appreciation) or implicitly expressed by 0.

Problem Statement:
•	Find out the frequency of books published each year. (Hint: Use Boooks.csv file for this)
•	Find out in which year maximum number of books were published
•	Find out how many book were published based on ranking in the year 2002.¬ ( Hint: Use Book.csv and Book-Ratings.csv)
